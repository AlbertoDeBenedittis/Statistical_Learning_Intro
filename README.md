In this repository are collected some of the exercises provided in 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning' plus some other exercises provided by my teacher (Prof. Vinciotti).
All the exercises have been made using R and they are typically R-Markdown files. The data and the text of the exercises can be found in the pdf documents.
